# CRNN with MobileViT Pytorch 

This project is a learning attempt on Scene Text Recognition. A total of three DNN models were implemented and their effectiveness are compared in a rudementary study. 

## Language and environments 

Python 3.11 with jupyter notebook


## Usage

The implemented models are trained in Training.ipynb

The graphs for training loss and validation accuracy are in Graphs.ipynb

The evaluation of models are done in evaluation.ipynb
